# LDSI project
## WS 2021 - 2022 at TUM
### Hypothetical Scenario:
You are a data scientist on a consulting team hired by the US Board of Veteran's Appeals.
Your project is to develop a new search engine for BVA decisions. The goal is to produce a
system capable of processing decisions and extracting the reasons for why cases where
granted, denied, or remanded. The institution has asked you to survey relevant literature and
conduct a pilot experiment so that an informed decision can be made about how to invest
development resources. The analytical objective of the project is to test whether different
kinds of sentence annotations/markup for BVA decisions can be automated, what lessons can
be drawn regarding the difficulty of classifying certain types, and what challenges are there for
generally handling BVA decision texts in NLP pipelines.
