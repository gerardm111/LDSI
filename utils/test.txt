Auringer, Law Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1982 to \r\nSeptember 2002.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a March 2003 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nSt. Petersburg, Florida, which denied entitlement to the \r\nbenefit currently sought on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran's sleep apnea has been medically related to his \r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nSleep apnea was incurred in the veteran's active duty \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the agency of \r\noriginal jurisdiction (AOJ) has a duty to notify and assist \r\nthe veteran under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 (West 2002) and \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2006).  As will be discussed below, the \r\nBoard finds that service connection for sleep apnea is \r\nwarranted; therefore, a full discussion of whether VA met \r\nthese duties is not needed.  It is important to note, \r\nhowever, that although the record reflects that the AOJ has \r\nnot provided notice with respect to the initial disability \r\nrating and effective date elements of the claim, those \r\nmatters are not currently before the Board and the AOJ will \r\nhave the opportunity to provide the required notice before \r\nits decision.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nService Connection \r\n\r\nThe veteran seeks service connection for sleep apnea, which \r\nhe contends was incurred during his military service.  \r\nSpecifically, the veteran contends that during his active \r\nduty service he experienced loud nighttime snoring with \r\nepisodes of gasping and choking during the night.  See report \r\nof private sleep disorder physician, April 2003.  \r\n\r\nTo establish service connection, three elements must be \r\nestablished.  There must be medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See 38 C.F.R.  \ufffd 3.303 (2006); see also Hickson \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 247,  253 (1999).\r\n\r\nIn January 2003, the veteran underwent a sleep study.  \r\nSubsequent outpatient clinical records demonstrate a \r\ndiagnosis of overall moderate level obstructive sleep apnea.  \r\nSee VA Sleep Disorders Clinic Records, January 2003 to March \r\n2003.\r\nAccordingly, the first element of service connection has been \r\nsatisfied.  \r\n\r\nService medical records show that in May 2002, the veteran \r\nreported his intent to seek disability from VA for a sleep \r\ndisorder which he referred to as \"apnea.\"  See Report of \r\nMedical Assessment, May 2002.  During an exam the following \r\nmonth, the doctor noted that the veteran had \"a lot of \r\nbreathing problems at night - when he sleeps.\"  See Report \r\nof Medical Examination, June 2002.  These records document \r\nsymptoms indicative of sleep apnea during the veteran's \r\nactive duty service, and therefore satisfy the second element \r\nof in-service incurrence.\r\n  \r\nThe veteran also has submitted a report from his private \r\nphysician who specializes in sleep disorders, in which the \r\nphysician recognized the veteran's reported five year history \r\nof symptoms indicative of sleep apnea.  See report of private \r\nsleep disorder physician, April 2003.  The physician's \r\nopinion serves to connect the veteran's current diagnosis to \r\nhis symptoms in service five years prior.  Because a medical \r\nnexus has been established, service connection is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for sleep apnea is granted.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJ.
