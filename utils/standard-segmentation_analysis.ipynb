Griffin\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1972 to July \\r\\n1975.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans\\' Appeals (Board) on \\r\\nappeal from a decision of July 2005 by the Department of Veteran \\r\\nAffairs (VA) Houston, Texas Regional Office (RO).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board remanded the present claim under review for further \\r\\ndevelopment in July 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2010 and July 2010 documents, the Veteran raised \\r\\nclaims regarding (i) a skin disorder, to include as \\r\\nsecondary to herbicide exposure, (ii) sleep apnea, (iii) \\r\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome and (iv) a clothing allowance.  \\r\\nThese do not appear to have been adjudicated by the Agency \\r\\nof Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, the Board does \\r\\nnot have jurisdiction over them, and they are referred to \\r\\nthe AOJ for appropriate action. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFINDING OF FACT\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no competent evidence of record linking any currently \\r\\ndiagnosed right knee disorder to military service or any incident \\r\\ntherein, to include in-service treatment, and there is no \\r\\nevidence of any complaints or diagnosis of any such disorder for \\r\\nmany years after separation.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\r\\n\\r\\nA right knee disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by \\r\\nservice and may not be so presumed.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, \\r\\n1112, 1113, 1131, 1137 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. �� \\r\\n3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2009).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\\r\\n\\r\\nDuties to Assist and Notify\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), the United \\r\\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a \\r\\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) notice, as required \\r\\nby 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103(a), must (1) inform the claimant about the \\r\\ninformation and evidence not of record that is necessary to \\r\\nsubstantiate the claim; (2) inform the claimant about the \\r\\ninformation and evidence that the VA will seek to provide; and \\r\\n(3) inform the claimant about the information and evidence the \\r\\nclaimant is expected to provide.  The notice must be provided to \\r\\na claimant before the initial unfavorable RO decision on a claim \\r\\nfor VA benefits.  The VA\\'s notice requirements were accomplished \\r\\nin February 2005 and August 2005.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the duty to assist, VA has attempted to secure all \\r\\nrelevant documentation to the extent possible.  The Veteran was \\r\\nafforded multiple VA examinations and his service, VA and private \\r\\ntreatment records have been obtained.  What is more, the \\r\\nVeteran\\'s request for a hearing has been honored and the AMC/RO \\r\\nhas fully complied with the Board\\'s July 2005 remand \\r\\ninstructions.  There remains no issue as to the substantial \\r\\ncompleteness of the Veteran\\'s claim.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Veteran presently seeks to establish service connection for a \\r\\nright knee disorder.  More precisely, the Veteran maintains that \\r\\nhe injured his right knee during a training exercise in-service, \\r\\nwhich caused his current right knee disorder.  See Hearing \\r\\nTrans., p. 3, May 6, 2009.  This forms the basis of the Veteran\\'s \\r\\npresent service connection claim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tService Connection Laws and Regulations\\r\\n\\r\\nService connection may be granted for disability due to disease \\r\\nor injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \\r\\n�� 1110, 1131.  If a chronic disorder, such as arthritis, is \\r\\nmanifest to a compensable degree within one year after separation \\r\\nfrom service, the disorder may be presumed to have been incurred \\r\\nin-service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \\r\\n�� 3.307, 3.309.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to establish service connection, three elements must be \\r\\nsatisfied.  There must be (1) medical evidence of a current \\r\\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \\r\\nevidence of the in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease \\r\\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \\r\\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  \\r\\nSee 38 C.F.R. � 3.303; see also Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. \\r\\n247, 253 (1999).  The determination as to whether these \\r\\nrequirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence \\r\\nof record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative \\r\\nvalue.  See Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBackground\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Veteran\\'s June 1972 enlistment examination noted no \\r\\nabnormalities associated with his (i) feet; (ii) lower \\r\\nextremities; or (iii) spine and musculoskeletal system.  In March \\r\\n1973, the Veteran was treated for knee related complaints (the \\r\\nrecord does not indicate if these complaints were associated with \\r\\nthe left or right knee).  On examination, the military medical \\r\\nprofessional documented the absence of any knee swelling or \\r\\neffusion and reported that the knee \"ligaments seem[ed] intact \\r\\nas no laxity [was] noted.\"  At this time, the Veteran was \\r\\ndiagnosed with a bruised tibial tuberosity, and no further knee \\r\\nrelated treatment or complaints were documented for the balance \\r\\nof the Veteran\\'s service.  The Veteran\\'s July 1975 separation \\r\\nexamination does not appear fully completed by the military \\r\\nmedical professional and it is unclear if any abnormalities of \\r\\n(i) the feet; (ii) lower extremities; or (iii) spine and \\r\\nmusculoskeletal system were present.  Nonetheless, aside from the \\r\\nMarch 1973 knee treatment, the Veteran\\'s service treatment \\r\\nrecords are absent of any knee related treatments or complaints.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first post-service treatment for any right knee disorder is \\r\\ndocumented in a January 1996 private operation report.  This \\r\\nrecord reflects the Veteran\\'s preoperative diagnosis with right \\r\\nknee internal derangement and postoperative diagnosis with a \\r\\nright knee medial meniscus and medial plica tear.  At this time, \\r\\nthe private physician reported the details of the Veteran\\'s \\r\\nsurgery, but provided no suggestion, or opinion, that the \\r\\nVeteran\\'s right knee disorder was related to military service or \\r\\nany incident therein.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate treatment records, documenting the Veteran\\'s August 1999 \\r\\nwork related right knee injury have also been made of record.  In \\r\\nan August 1999 statement, private physician R. Pena, M.D., \\r\\nrecounted the events surrounding this work related injury, \\r\\ndetailed the present condition of the Veteran\\'s right knee, and \\r\\nreported that an x-ray revealed \"some [right knee] arthritis and \\r\\nwhat appear[ed] to be a compression fracture of lateral tibial \\r\\nplateau...[suggesting the presence of] an old compression \\r\\nfracture.\"  There is otherwise no opinion or suggestion that the \\r\\ndiagnosed disorder, or any other right knee disorder, was caused \\r\\nby the Veteran\\'s military service or any incident therein.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to assist the Veteran substantiate his service \\r\\nconnection claim, he was provided a September 2006 VA \\r\\nexamination.  During the examination interview, the Veteran \\r\\nrecounted injuring his right knee in-service and stated that \\r\\n\"[s]ince then...his knees have continued to degenerate.\"  The \\r\\nexaminer then performed an appropriate examination, to include x-\\r\\nrays, and diagnosed moderate right knee degenerative arthritis.  \\r\\nAdditionally, based on the Veteran\\'s account of his disorder, \\r\\npresent examination findings and the medical evidence of record, \\r\\nthe VA examiner indicated that an opinion relating any right knee \\r\\ndisorder to military service could not be made without resorting \\r\\nto speculation.  The examiner cited (i) the absence of any \\r\\nnotation of whether the in-service knee treatment was associated \\r\\nwith the right or left knee, (ii) the \"mild\" nature of the in-\\r\\nservice knee injury, without any noted follow-up treatment, and \\r\\n(iii) the Veteran\\'s treatment for a work related right knee \\r\\ninjury, in 1999, to support the provided opinion.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Veteran was provided another VA examination in December 2009 \\r\\nand he provided an identical account of right knee \\r\\nsymptomatology, as was provided at his December 2006 VA \\r\\nexamination.  At this time, the examiner specifically recorded \\r\\nthe Veteran\\'s extensive post-service right and left knee \\r\\ntreatments, including knee replacements and arthroscopic surgery.  \\r\\nBased on current examination findings and the medical evidence of \\r\\nrecord, the VA examiner diagnosed a stable right knee joint, \\r\\nsecondary to a total knee replacement.  The examiner then opined \\r\\nthat none of the Veteran\\'s right knee disorders were related to \\r\\nmilitary service or any incident therein.  To support this \\r\\nopinion, the examiner highlighted the significant amount of time \\r\\nfollowing the Veteran\\'s separation from service and his first \\r\\npost-service right knee treatment and noted that the Veteran\\'s \\r\\nnumerous surgical interventions (both left and right knee) \\r\\nsuggested the onset of a right knee disorder occurred after \\r\\nservice, in approximately 1996, and not in-service.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous post-service right knee treatment records have been \\r\\nassociated with the Veteran\\'s claims folder.  These treatment \\r\\nrecords document the Veteran\\'s total knee replacements.  See VA \\r\\nOrthopedic Surgery Note, August 1, 2008; VA Orthopedic Physician \\r\\nNote, December 20, 2004; VA Orthopedic Note, October 12, 2004; \\r\\nPrivate Hospital Surgery Note, July 11, 1997.  Additionally, \\r\\nthese records document the Veteran\\'s account that consistent knee \\r\\npain had its onset in approximately 2002, and that he injured his \\r\\nknee in Vietnam.  See VA Primary Care New Patient/Annual Note, \\r\\nJune 7, 2004; VA Psychiatry New Patient Note, October 21, 2004.  \\r\\nThese post-service treatment records do not provide any \\r\\nsuggestion or opinion that any right knee disorder was caused by, \\r\\nor related to, the Veteran\\'s military service.  \\r\\n\\r\\n      Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any service connection claim, medical records and examinations \\r\\nare highly probative in evaluating whether service connection is \\r\\nwarranted.  In the present matter, the most probative medical \\r\\nevidence of record weighs against the Veteran\\'s service \\r\\nconnection claim.  The August 1999 statement of private physician \\r\\nR. Pena, M.D., comes the closet to weighing in favor of the \\r\\nVeteran\\'s service connection claim; however, Dr. Pena provided no \\r\\nopinion or suggestion that any \"old compression fracture\" was \\r\\ncaused by the Veteran\\'s military service or any incident therein, \\r\\nnor do any treatment records generated in connection with the \\r\\ntreatment of this job related right knee injury.  Essentially, \\r\\nDr. Pena\\'s August 1999 statement (and treatment records) is of \\r\\nlittle, if any, probative value, as on its face the statement \\r\\ndoes not suggest it is more likely than not that any old fracture \\r\\nis related to the Veteran\\'s military service or any incident \\r\\ntherein.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. \\r\\n1997) (the Board has authority to discount the weight and probity \\r\\nof evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its \\r\\nrelationship to other items of evidence).  \\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, the December 2009 VA examination opinion that weighs \\r\\nagainst the Veteran\\'s is clearly stated and supported by logic \\r\\nand reasoning.  The examiner specifically opined that no right \\r\\nknee disorder was caused by the Veteran\\'s military service or any \\r\\nincident therein, and that any such disorder was more likely \\r\\nrelated to a 1996 post-service diagnosis and/or injury.  In \\r\\nproviding this opinion, the examiner cited both (i) the twenty-\\r\\nthree year gap from 1973 to 1996, where the Veteran was not \\r\\ntreated for any right knee disorder and (ii) the chronology of \\r\\nthe Veteran\\'s bilateral knee surgeries to support the provided \\r\\nopinion.  Further, a review of this December 2009 VA examination \\r\\nreport and opinion, documents the examiner\\'s consideration and \\r\\nanalysis of (i) the Veteran\\'s account of symptomatology; (ii) the \\r\\nmedical evidence of records; and (iii) current examination \\r\\nfindings to support the provided opinion.  As such, the Board \\r\\nfinds this opinion to be competent and highly probative evidence, \\r\\nwhich tends to weigh against the Veteran\\'s claim.  See Nieves-\\r\\nRodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 300 (2008) (\"[M]ost of the \\r\\nprobative value of a medical opinion comes from its \\r\\nreasoning.\").  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the September 2006 VA examination opinion also \\r\\nprovides a medical opinion that weighs against the Veteran\\'s \\r\\nclaim.  This examination opinion is stated clearly and provides \\r\\nclear logic for the provided opinion, making it highly probative.  \\r\\nAlso, the examiner\\'s opinion, on its face, indicates the examiner \\r\\ndeclined to speculate or make vague and equivocal findings.  \\r\\nEssentially, based on (i) the medical evidence of record, (ii) \\r\\nthe Veteran\\'s account of symptomatology and (iii) current \\r\\nexamination findings, the examiner was unable to relate any right \\r\\nknee disorder, or similar condition, to military service or any \\r\\nincident therein.  Stated differently, the examiner found there \\r\\nwas no evidence currently of record to support an opinion \\r\\nrelating the Veteran\\'s claimed right knee disorder to his \\r\\nmilitary service or any incident therein, without resorting to \\r\\nspeculation.  What is more, the examiner indicated that a \\r\\ndefinitive opinion relating the Veteran\\'s disorder to military \\r\\nservice was precluded by numerous factors, to include the absence \\r\\nof any documented right knee treatment for many years and the \\r\\n\"mild\" nature of the noted in-service knee treatment (without \\r\\nany relevant follow-up).  Accordingly, the September 2006 VA \\r\\nopinion is probative of the question at issue, and adequate for \\r\\nthe Board to rely on regarding whether the Veteran\\'s current \\r\\ndisorder is related to his military service or any incident \\r\\ntherein.  See Roberts v. West, 13 Vet. App. 185, 189 (1999) \\r\\n(holding that \"the fact that [a] medical opinion [is] \\r\\ninconclusive ... does not mean that the examination was \\r\\ninadequate.\").  Therefore, the Board finds that the most \\r\\npersuasive medical evidence of record weighs against the claim.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWithout question, the Board has considered the Veteran\\'s \\r\\nassertions that his right knee disorder had its onset in-service, \\r\\nand/or was caused by his March 1973 knee injury.  However, in the \\r\\npresent circumstance, the Veteran does not have the medical \\r\\ntraining or expertise to provide a credible opinion to this \\r\\neffect.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (2006); \\r\\nsee also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \\r\\nIndeed, to provide a competent and credible opinion as to this \\r\\nmatter requires sophisticated medical examination and testing.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same, any account of experiencing continuous knee \\r\\nsymptoms after an in-service injury, and/or continuously since \\r\\nseparation, are of diminished probative value, as compared to the \\r\\nVeteran\\'s many statements made solely for the purpose of seeking \\r\\nmedical treatment-not VA compensation.  See Hearing Trans., pp. \\r\\n4-5, May 6, 2009.  At a June 2004 VA treatment, the Veteran \\r\\nspecifically indicated that he experienced the onset of \\r\\ncontinuous knee pain in approximately 2002, some twenty-seven \\r\\nyears after service (1975-2002).  See VA Primary Care New \\r\\nPatient/Annual Note, June 7, 2004.  Additionally, when providing \\r\\na full account of his right knee disorder, the Veteran reported \\r\\nthat he injured his knee in Vietnam, (the record shows the \\r\\nVeteran was involved in the evacuation of Saigon in April 1975), \\r\\nmaking no reference to any March 1973 knee injury/treatment.  See \\r\\nVA Psychiatry New Patient Note, October 21, 2004.  As such, the \\r\\nBoard finds the Veteran\\'s account of events made closer to the \\r\\ntime of his in-service injury and his post-service statements \\r\\nmade solely for the purpose of seeking medical treatment, to be \\r\\nhighly probative and likely more accurate, as compared to \\r\\nstatements made a considerable time after the event and after \\r\\nseeking VA monetary compensation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, although the Veteran reports receiving VA knee \\r\\ntreatment from 1975 to 1979, at the VA Medical Center in Houston, \\r\\nTexas, an exhaustive search at this location indicated no such \\r\\ntreatment records existed.  See Hearing Trans., pp. 4-5, May 6, \\r\\n2009; Response to Request for Records, VA Houston, Texas \\r\\nInformation Unit, August 21, 2009.  As such, there is otherwise \\r\\nno indication that any right knee disorder was diagnosed or \\r\\ntreated for many years (1975-1996) following his separation from \\r\\nservice.  This post-service period without complaints or \\r\\ntreatment is evidence that there has not been a continuity of \\r\\nsymptomatology, and it weighs heavily against the claims herein.  \\r\\nSee Mense v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 354, 356 (1991) (holding that \\r\\nVA did not err in denying service connection when the veteran \\r\\nfailed to provide evidence which demonstrated continuity of \\r\\nsymptomatology, and failed to account for the lengthy time period \\r\\nfor which there is no clinical documentation of his low back \\r\\ncondition).  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidered together, (i) the absence of any competent, credible \\r\\nevidence reflecting the presence of a right knee disorder in-\\r\\nservice or linking any such disorder to military service and (ii) \\r\\nthe many years between separation and any diagnosis or treatment \\r\\nof any such condition, weigh against the Veteran\\'s claim.  \\r\\nAccordingly, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the \\r\\nVeteran\\'s claim, the reasonable doubt doctrine is not for \\r\\napplication, and his service connection claim for a right knee \\r\\ndisorder is denied.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER\\r\\n\\r\\nService connection for a right knee disorder is denied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n____________________________________________\\r\\nMICHAEL E.
